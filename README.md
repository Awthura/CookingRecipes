# CookingRecipes
This is a University project for Software Engineering module at THD. I worked as a team leader and led a team of 11 students to develop a website that displays &amp; filters cooking recipes from a database. Pipeline used was (Springboot + MongoDb + Vue) &amp; dockerized. This is the reupload of the project hosted originally on Gitlab.
