# CookingRecipes
This is a University project for Software Engineering module at THD. I worked as a team leader and led a team of 11 students to develop a website that displays &amp; filters cooking recipes from a database. Pipeline used was (Springboot + MongoDb + Vue) &amp; dockerized. This is the reupload of the project hosted originally on Gitlab. 

# Run the Project
To start the project please instal docker first and write "docker-compose up" in your command prompt. 
To start the the backend alone, type "mvn spring:boot run"
